** 0. Donking
*** 0. What is OOP's overall donking frequency?
**** My Answer: 0%

**** Solver

**** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

*** 0. What hands does OOP donk with most frequently?
**** My Answer
Maybe a couple 6x, but not too many because then the checking raise will be empty of value.

**** Solver

**** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

** 1. What will the overall c-betting frequency be?
*** My Answer: 65%

*** Solver: 68%
** 2. If I was to choose just one size, should it be small or large?
*** My Answer: Small (60% : 5%)

*** Solver: Small (68% : 0.0)

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

** 3. What will BB's check-raising frequency be?
*** My Answer: 10%
+ Any 6x
+ TT
+ Axh
+ some draws like 8h7h, 9h8h, 9h7h

*** Solver: 20%
+ Any 6x (less so for Q6s-A6s)
+ T7s and T8s x/r @ 50%
+ Ah2h-Ah9h (AhQh and AhJh are checked 100%)
  - Interesting, out of Ah7h-Ah9h, the (raise/call) values are:
    + Ah7h: 38% / 62%
    + Ah8h: 44% / 56%
    + Ah9h: 34% / 66%

    Meanwhile, lower Ahxh raise a bit more (57%, 58%, 48%, and 72%)

    Is there some blocker action going on here?

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

** 4. What will the pure and/or most frequently bet hands be?
*** My Answer
+ TT
+ 66
+ Any 6x (65s, 76s)
+ Ahxh
+ Some Asxs?
+ ATo w/ Ah?
+ 7h8h and 8h9h for SFD


*** Solver
+ 22, 33 [!]
+ TT
+ JJ, QQ [!]
+ 66
+ Any 6x (65s, 76s)
+ 8h7s, 9h8h
+ 87s, 98s (no hearts) also bet pretty frequently [!]
+ ATs [!]
+ ATo: this hand bets less with the nut BDFD blocker (As), but is still top/top
  so bets a lot.
+ QJo, KJo: these types of hands seem to follow rules:

  - Heart: bet more
  - Spade: bet less

  This makes sense: we want the opponent to have some BDFDs (spades), and we
  _don't_ we also want to have the hearts ourselves. A hand like KhQs blocks a lot
  of BB's BDFD hands, like KsQs, AsQs, QsJs, QsTs, Qs9s.

  The lowest bet combos are those with both a heart and a spade: these combos
  mean that we are drawing to a BDFD, and that we are also blocking a lot of
  BB's BDFDs for the spades. This makes their calling/raising ranges a lot
  stronger, and our semibluffs less profitable.

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

I was trying to be too selective with what I was putting in my betting range,
but since I want go get to 68% (or even just 60%), I want to be betting a lot
more things. Especially given that I want to bet a linear range, this means a
lot of stuff like top-top, etc.


** 5. What will the pure and/or most frequently checked hands be?
*** My Answer
+ A3-A5s (no heart)
+ 33-55

Aside from that, I think a lot of high cards will be checking frequently (lets
say about 50% of the time on average), like Kxs (no heart, no ten), Qx suited
(no heart, no ten)

*** Solver
Very few purely checked hands, and these mostly revolve around blocking BDFDs
for the opponent.
+ KTo w/ King of spades
+ QTo with the Queen of spades
+ AsQs
+ AsJs

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)
I'm just not checking that much. Ace high is good, low pairs are good. I have
such a big equity advantage that I should bet just about everything, at least some of the time!

* 6d6c5s
** 0. Donking
*** 0. What is OOP's overall donking frequency?
**** My Answer: 25%

**** Solver: 29%

**** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

*** 0. What hands does OOP donk with most frequently?
**** My Answer
+ 66
+ 55
+ 65s
+ 44, 33, 22?
+ 6x
+ 87 (s/o)
+ 98s
+ 77, 88
+ A5s
+ K5s
+ Some BDFDs (maybe AQs, AKs, KQs?)
**** Solver
The solver is donking with made hands like 55, 6x (but not 66 or A6s), and has
some OESDs like 87 and 43s. Some gut shots like 42s, and some BDFDs with a 7 and
a high card (Q7s-A7s w/ BDFD). These hands serve to make flushes, but also have
some BDSD potential.

+ **Question:** BB is semibluffing with Q7c, but this blocks potential calls
  that BB would want LJ to make.
  - **Answer:** Turns out, 87 is hardly ever opened from LJ. At first I thought
    that the blocker to 76s was a benefit, but this is only the case when we are
    holding the 7 of spades, and since this is such a small part of LJ's range,
    this probably doesn't really matter.

Other A-high BDFDs are donked as well: A3s and A4s are both donked when they
have a BDFD. Additionally, A7s-A9s are donked @ about 50%, presumably because of
the straight draw and the high card. These don't need a BDFD to bet.

**** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)
+ 22-44 is not donked frequently (around 20%)
+ 66 is mainly checked
+ 98s is mainly checked
+ 77, 88 are checked
+ A5s and K5s are checked

Here is the breakdown of donking frequencies:

Made hands:
+ trips+: 12%
+ pair: 15.5% (6% weak pair)
+ Ace high/no made hand: 72%

Draws (of Ace high/NMH):
+ OESD: 19%
+ Gutshot: 29%
+ 2 card BDFD: 49.4%
+ Overcards: 78%


Take away: BB is donking with 72% semibluffs, high cards and only 12% strong
hands. Against a GTO opponent, LJ should be defending wide (maybe around 60%+
call, 5% raise)


** 1. What will the overall c-betting frequency be?
*** My Answer: 50%

*** Solver: 51.5% small, 9.25% big
*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

I was short by about 10%. The lesson here is that LJ's range is strong enough to
totally whiff the flop and still have a winning range...LJ has 56% equity on
this flop, and after BB checks, this goes up to 57%.
** 3. What will BB's check-raising frequency be?
*** My Answer: 40%

*** Solver: 21% for small raise, 13.6% for large raise

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

** 2. If I was to choose just one size, should it be small or large?
*** My Answer: Small
*** Solver: Small, but larger sizes make up a better part of this range
*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

I'm not sure why the larger bet size is being used more here. Mainly betting
larger with 6x and then some random stuff like QTo, QJo.

This range is rather polarized:
+ 27.55 Overpair +
  - 23.0 Overpair
  - 4.7 % Trips+
+ 2% Other pair
+ 70.5% ace high/NMH
  - 66.6% over cards
  - 27.5% 2crd BDFD

** 4. What will the pure and/or most frequently bet hands be?
*** My Answer
+ 66
+ 55
+ A5s
+ 87s, 98s
+ 65s

*** Solver
+ 44-TT
+ A2s-A6s
+ 65s
+ suited connectors up to KQs (small part of range)
+ QTo, KTo, QJo, KJo
+ 6x, 5x

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

LJ wants to bet a LOT of hands here. I didn't take enough of them into account in my above list.
** 5. What will the pure and/or most frequently checked hands be?
*** My Answer
+ High unsuited connectors

*** Solver

Not much, basically Ats and A9s are the only hands that are checked almost purely. After that, overcards are bet and checked about evenly.

**** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

** 1. What will the overall c-betting frequency be?
*** My Answer: 100%
*** Solver: 97.8

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)
Yeah, I'm just gonna bet this 100%. The only thing that is checked w/ more than
like 1% frequency is K7h. Solver has me checking everything w/ p=0.01 or so, so
my range would be balanced, but that's a pain to implement. Easier to just cbet
everything.
** 2. If I was to choose just one size, should it be small or large?
*** My Answer: Small
I'm betting 100% of hands, bet them small and linear

*** Solver: Small: 51%, Large: 47%
This is very close actually.
*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

So I think if I chose just one size it would be small still, but I don't think
it matters here.

Interesting to note, low pocket pairs are betting larger here, QQ is bet
smaller, 88 is bet larger, as are 98s, 87s. Everything else is split about
50/50.
** 3. What will BB's check-raising frequency be?
*** My Answer: 10%? Lower?
I think things like JJ and 88 will x/r, and any 2pair (KJ, J8) will be x/r.
Bluffs will include QT, T9, and some A-high BDFDs.

Does BB raise backdoor nut flush draws w/ blockers to the OESDs? i think I'd
prefer to raise with something like A5s since this unblocks a bunch of straight
draws and flush draws that LJ might have, and BB wants to keep as many of those
in LJ betting range as possible.

*** Solver; 13% vs small bet, 10% vs large bet

*** Solver: Yup

** 5. What will the pure and/or most frequently checked hands be?
*** My Answer: We check nothing all of the time

*** Solver: K7 of hearts. We check that one. Aaaand that's it? yup, that's it.

I'm not sure if it's the J -> T or the 8 -> 3 that hurts us here.

Almost all of them. 99 is checked almost exclusively, K9 is checked frequently,
