** 0. Donking
*** 0. What is OOP's overall donking frequency?
**** My Answer: 0%

*** 0. What hands does OOP donk with most frequently?
**** My Answer
Maybe a couple 6x, but not too many because then the checking raise will be empty of value.

** 1. What will the overall c-betting frequency be?
*** My Answer: 65%

*** Solver: 68%
** 2. If I was to choose just one size, should it be small or large?
*** My Answer: Small (60% : 5%)

*** Solver: Small (68% : 0.0)

** 3. What will BB's check-raising frequency be?
*** My Answer: 10%
+ Any 6x
+ TT
+ Axh
+ some draws like 8h7h, 9h8h, 9h7h

*** Solver: 20%
+ Any 6x (less so for Q6s-A6s)
+ T7s and T8s x/r @ 50%
+ Ah2h-Ah9h (AhQh and AhJh are checked 100%)
  - Interesting, out of Ah7h-Ah9h, the (raise/call) values are:
    + Ah7h: 38% / 62%
    + Ah8h: 44% / 56%
    + Ah9h: 34% / 66%

    Meanwhile, lower Ahxh raise a bit more (57%, 58%, 48%, and 72%)

    Is there some blocker action going on here?

** 4. What will the pure and/or most frequently bet hands be?
*** My Answer
+ TT
+ 66
+ Any 6x (65s, 76s)
+ Ahxh
+ Some Asxs?
+ ATo w/ Ah?
+ 7h8h and 8h9h for SFD


*** Solver
+ 22, 33 [!]
+ TT
+ JJ, QQ [!]
+ 66
+ Any 6x (65s, 76s)
+ 8h7s, 9h8h
+ 87s, 98s (no hearts) also bet pretty frequently [!]
+ ATs [!]
+ ATo: this hand bets less with the nut BDFD blocker (As), but is still top/top
  so bets a lot.
+ QJo, KJo: these types of hands seem to follow rules:

  - Heart: bet more
  - Spade: bet less

  This makes sense: we want the opponent to have some BDFDs (spades), and we
  _don't_ we also want to have the hearts ourselves. A hand like KhQs blocks a lot
  of BB's BDFD hands, like KsQs, AsQs, QsJs, QsTs, Qs9s.

  The lowest bet combos are those with both a heart and a spade: these combos
  mean that we are drawing to a BDFD, and that we are also blocking a lot of
  BB's BDFDs for the spades. This makes their calling/raising ranges a lot
  stronger, and our semibluffs less profitable.

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

I was trying to be too selective with what I was putting in my betting range,
but since I want go get to 68% (or even just 60%), I want to be betting a lot
more things. Especially given that I want to bet a linear range, this means a
lot of stuff like top-top, etc.


** 5. What will the pure and/or most frequently checked hands be?
*** My Answer
+ A3-A5s (no heart)
+ 33-55

Aside from that, I think a lot of high cards will be checking frequently (lets
say about 50% of the time on average), like Kxs (no heart, no ten), Qx suited
(no heart, no ten)

*** Solver
Very few purely checked hands, and these mostly revolve around blocking BDFDs
for the opponent.
+ KTo w/ King of spades
+ QTo with the Queen of spades
+ AsQs
+ AsJs

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)
I'm just not checking that much. Ace high is good, low pairs are good. I have
such a big equity advantage that I should bet just about everything, at least some of the time!

* 6d6c5s
** 0. Donking
*** 0. What is OOP's overall donking frequency?
**** My Answer: 25%

**** Solver: 29%

**** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

*** 0. What hands does OOP donk with most frequently?
**** My Answer
+ 66
+ 55
+ 65s
+ 44, 33, 22?
+ 6x
+ 87 (s/o)
+ 98s
+ 77, 88
+ A5s
+ K5s
+ Some BDFDs (maybe AQs, AKs, KQs?)
**** Solver
The solver is donking with made hands like 55, 6x (but not 66 or A6s), and has
some OESDs like 87 and 43s. Some gut shots like 42s, and some BDFDs with a 7 and
a high card (Q7s-A7s w/ BDFD). These hands serve to make flushes, but also have
some BDSD potential.

+ **Question:** BB is semibluffing with Q7c, but this blocks potential calls
  that BB would want LJ to make.
  - **Answer:** I /think/ what's happening here
