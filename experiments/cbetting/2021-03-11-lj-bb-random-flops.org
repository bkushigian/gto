** 0. Donking
*** 0. What is OOP's overall donking frequency?
**** My Answer: 0%-5%
**** Solver: 3.5%
*** 0. What hands does OOP donk with most frequently?
**** My Answer
77, 55, some flush draws, some 86, 64

**** Solver
Low frequency with any set and many draws

**** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

** 1. What will the overall c-betting frequency be?
*** My Answer: 75%

*** Solver: 52%

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)
This flop isn't as good for my range as maybe I had thought at first, and there
are a lot of bad turns
** 2. If I was to choose just one size, should it be small or large?
*** My Answer: Large (or maybe mix evenly between two)

*** Solver: Small

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)
I'm a little surpised by this. Since I'm betting less I thought I'd bet bigger

** 3. What will BB's check-raising frequency be?
*** My Answer: 10%-15%
They have some sets that want to x/r, and maybe some 2p, and a fair number of
draws they can balance with.

*** Solver

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

** 4. What will the pure and/or most frequently bet hands be?
*** My Answer
77, TT, JJ-KK, Acxc, AT unblocking Ac, KT unblocking clubs

*** Solver
77, TT, JJ, less wit QQ and KK, lots of Ax clubs (AcJc-Ac9c). KT doesn't bet as much

Also, QJs, KJs and AJs are all betting more than I thought

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)


** 5. What will the pure and/or most frequently checked hands be?
*** My Answer
QTs, QJs, KQs

*** Solver
AdKd is checking a lot, as is 88, but just about everything else is betting at least 50%

Woah, did not see that coming! Donking with 55, 22, 65s, 75s, 53s, and (~50) A5s and A2s

** Thoughts
I missed that the ace interacts with a lot of wheel draws...any 3 or 4, not to
mention that LJ's range doesn't interact with the bottom of the board at all.

** 1. What will the overall c-betting frequency be?
*** My Answer: 50%

*** Solver: 100%

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)
The board is disconnected, BB is unlikely to hit anything. To make them call
when we have value we need to bet everything so we have enough bluffs?

** 2. If I was to choose just one size, should it be small or large?
*** My Answer: small

*** Solver: small

** 3. What will BB's check-raising frequency be?
*** My Answer: 20%
x/r T7, sets, 7x, ATo, 98s, 87s, T9s, JTs
*** Solver: 23%
Does not x/r ATo. Does x/r sets, gutshots, 86s (?), 87s, and T7s.

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)
Yeah, I wa sactually suspicious about ATo when I wrote it, doesn't seem like a good x/r candidate.

** 4. What will the pure and/or most frequently bet hands be?

TT+, 77, JTs, QJs (block JJ), AT

**** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

** 1. What will the overall c-betting frequency be?
*** My Answer: 100%
Board is disconnected, very few draws. I'm not worried about being x/r since
they basically have 44 and 99 (while I have 99 and AA), some backdoor draws (53,
BDFDs), and some 2p like A9 and A4

*** Solver: 89%

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

I'm checking KK and some QQ. A few ATs as well
** 2. If I was to choose just one size, should it be small or large?
*** My Answer: small
I want to bet everything, and I want them to come along

*** Solver: small

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

** 3. What will BB's check-raising frequency be?
*** My Answer: 10%-15%.
There aren't a ton of compelling bluffs on this board.

*** Solver: 16%

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)
A little higher than I thought. The low draw hands (54, 54, 43) w/ or without
pairs are x/r. Sets x/r. 2p x/r. To protect this, hands like 98s and 97 x/r as
well. Why do these x/r?

** 4. What will the pure and/or most frequently bet hands be?
*** My Answer: everything

*** Solver: everything except KK, and a bit of QQ/ATs

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)


** 5. What will the pure and/or most frequently checked hands be?
*** My Answer: nothing

*** Solver: KK checks 50%

** 3. What will BB's check-raising frequency be?
*** My Answer: 15%
x/r with sets, oesds, some 2p, and maybe some things like T9s
*** Solver: 17%
sets, T9, J9, 98, A9, A8, T7...basically what I was predicting. 86 surprises me

Twotone, big cards, QT, AQ are draws (LJ has these, BB doesn't)

*** Solver: small

*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)

** 3. What will BB's check-raising frequency be?
*** My Answer: 20%
Wants to x/r sets (JJ, 44) as well as some 2p (KJo) and flush draws. Does BB x/r
nut flush draws or Qh flush draws? I think definitely x/r AhJh.

Check back some 99, TT, QQ, AJ (no flush draw) at low frequencies
*** Analysis (or Mistakes Were Made)
Nothing

* AsTs6c
No straights on board, gut shots, flush draws. Nutty hands will be sets. LJ has
AA TT while bb has TT 66, and these hands are the nuts. AT and A6 are the only
2pairs on the board. AT: BB has 6 combos (offsuit) vs LJ's 3 combos (suited).
When BB has ATo they block 2 of 3 LJ's ATs combos. A6: BB has only A6 (2 combos)

** 3. What will BB's check-raising frequency be?
*** My Answer: 20%
Value: sets (TT, 66), and 2p (ATo). Bluffs: some FDs, some BDFDs, some gutshots
(98, 87, 97, especially with flush draw or backdoor flush draw). Maybe some AJo

*** Solver: 20%

everything

Everything is mixed. Most bet are TT, JT, QT, KT, AT, AA, AK, AQ.

*** My Answer
nothing

*** Solver: WrONg
JJ, QQ, KK is checked a lot, AJ is checked 50%, KQ, KJ, QJ are checked 50%, A5s is checked 50%. Having a space makes these suited broadways slightly more likely to be bet.
